                  <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>Social media companies use trackers extensively to analyze users’ online behavior. The technology is very useful for providing customization and personalization services. However, it can also cause privacy concerns; many pieces of Personally Identifying Information (PII) might be collected during the process, e.g., IP address, location Info. There are also concerns about public surveillance based on the sensitive PII collected. In order to give people more control over their privacy, Redmorph developed a prvacy-protecting mobile application which has been test by The New York Times and rated as "the most thorough (application) in blocking trackers" <sup>[1]</sup>. Our team designed a study to evaluate the usability of this application.</p>

                  <h2>Objectives</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Evaluate usability of Redmorph tracker app</li>
								    <p>Evaluate the usability of the application. We will collect feedbacks from target users of this app and see how people like/dislike it, and make anaylsis based on the data.</p>
                    <li>Give effective suggestions and possible improvements to the app</li>
								    <p>Provide study-proved suggestions and possible improvements that can enhance the usability of the application.</p>
                  </ul>
	                  <h2>What We Did</h2>
								    <p>The study had four parts: pre-screening survey (distributed to the CMU Center for Behavioral and Decision participation pool), pre-interview (to gauge user attitudes), week-long diary study ( recorded user responses and behaviors online), and a post-interview. Analysis focused on qualitative data from the interviews and diary entries. The study was conducted with a total of 13 participants. We focused on whether the user can understand the technical jargon in Redmorph, whether they can configure the app, how well they can use various features and in which scenarios Redmorph breaks the functionality of existing apps. Our results suggest that even the
‘average’ user base includes many different levels of technological expertise. We provide various recommendations to improve the usability which hold true for other security apps.</p>
                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>I led group meetings to define our problems, review goals and progress that has been made, and reevaluate the status of the project to keep everything on track.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>I participated in all stages of the study: conducted pilot study, designed screening questions, designed and conducted a dozen surveys and interviews, and performed analysis.</P>
