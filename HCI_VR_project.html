                  <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>Virtual reality (VR) creates immersive surroundings for its users, usually in the form of head-mounted device (HMD) or similar equipment. However, it remains an intriguing topic as to how and to what extent users in and outside of VR world could share information and interact with each other. Vogel et al. <sup>[1]</sup> created an interactive public display that allows several levels of interaction proximity. Based on the idea, this project discusses designs that allow smooth transitions of HMD and non-HMD user interactions in virtual reality.</p>
                  <p style="font-size:0.8em">[1] Daniel Vogel, Ravin Balakrishnan. 2004. Interactive public ambient displays: transitioning from implicit to explicit, public to personal, interaction with multiple users. UIST '04. ACM New York, NY, USA. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/1029632.1029656</p>
                  <h2>Objectives</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Discuss and explore possibilities of different level of user interaction in VR world, mainly through manipulation of visual and audio experience</li>
                    <li>In addition, the designs must fulfill the following goals: immediate usability, short-duration fluid interaction, and easy to understand</li>
                  </ul>
	                <h2>What I Did</h2>
                  <p>A Microsoft Xbox One Kinect Motion Sensor is used to capture motions of HMD and Non-HMD users; my design allows up to four users interact at the same time. The HTC Vive VR system is used for creating virtual reality environment. Computation and scene rendering are done in Unity Game Engine via scripts written in C#. A projector is used for information display. The design consists of several phases, each represents an interaction scenario that allows certain information to be shared between users; transitions are triggered when physical distance between non-HMD and HMD users reaches certain threshold values.</p>

                  <br>
                  <ol>
                    <li><p>Ambient Information: default setting, when non-HMD is absent. The projector shows an omniscient perspective of VR world; a bystander (non-HMD user) can quickly grasp a sense of what is happening in the VR world and choose to approach for more information, which will trigger the shift to the second phase.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Implicit Interaction: instead of showing full knowledge of situation using an omniscient perspective, the projector switches to a limited 3rd person perspective, showing only limited but more detailed information of VR world. An avatar also appears in the projected scene, representing the non-HMD user and his/her location in VR world.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Explicit Interaction: projector switches from limited 3rd person to first person perspective, allowing non-HMD user to see through the eyes of his/her avatar, while the latter can decide whether or not to have non-HMD users join the VR world, if so, an avatar of non-HMD user will appear in the VR world via HMD, and so they can make interactions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Intimate Interaction: the most personal phase; not only does HMD user shares the same degree of visual experience with non-HMD users, audio surrounding is replicated using an external speaker.</p></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>The work focuses on creating smooth and highly-usable transitions between phases, so both sides (HMD and non-HMD users) understand what is happening and can manipulate in between phases as they wish.There are many possibilities left to be explored, which are discussed in later research by the Hyper-Reality Lab at National Chiao Tung University.</p>
