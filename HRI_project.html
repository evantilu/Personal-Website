                  <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>I believe that robotics-aid applications is one of the keys to enhance healthcare quality in the future. This project is part of my journey exploring how we can utilize varied technologies to improve people's living quality.
                  <br>Using Cozmo, a programmable robot developed by Anki Inc., we wanted to explore ways of communicating intents beyond just emotion, employing only non-verbal communication. We were interested in exploring ways that current modes of robotic communication can be used to convey different types of information, focusing particularly on communicating intent.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Objectives</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create nonverbal intent that are interpreted the same way by most or all users</li>
                    <li>Translate user-tested designs into a functional, preferably high fidelity prototype</li>
                  </ul>
	                <h2>What We Did</h2>
                  <p>We conducted a literature review to set the problem scope, choosing intents, tasks, and gestures and context that support them. We investigated a wide range of communication elements, e.g., eye gaze, gestures, body posture, touch, proxemics, and facial expressions. After defining intentions that we want to explore, we conducted the design thinking process to construct a set of tasks in which the robot elicits a series of communication with human subjects. We want to see how well human beings understand the robot's behavior and intention under different circumstances. Wizard of Oz tests were used frequently during the process, which helped us assess and refine several low-fidelity prototypes. After that, we transitioned to high-fidelity testing, using the high-fidelity coding prototype developed using framework and modules offered by Cozmo platform. The project concludes with a user study using a between-subjects design, followed by evaluation and reflection. Overall, we did see an improvement over the design iterations, and we believe that we have revealed some interesting messages in the field.

                  <h2>My Role</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I was the leader of the prototype implementation phase. I led the design of high-fidelity prototype and carried out the programming task.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <p>I learned and participated in the design phase. This is a successful interdisciplinary collaboration in the sense that I learned from members with marketing and design backgrounds, while teaching them programming skills.
